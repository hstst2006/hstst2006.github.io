Every self respecting blog needs a clichéd first post. This is that post. Because it is programming related it *has to be* "Hello, world!", there were no other options. Any program og programming project needs a "Hello world" part somehow. It shows that everything works as it should before you start doing serious work.

Because this is the first blog post, and also a sort of test page, I can use this opportunity to see how the markdown formatting looks on the github pages page for my own future reference. This way I can see how the formatting looks, but also not have to depend on the "Welcome to Jekyll" blogpost that was graciously supplied with this project template.

Among the included examples were the `file name formatting` of the blogposts in the `_posts` folder: `Year-Month-Date-title.md`

Also some examples on how to format code using tripple \` (tics? backtics?) like so:

```bash
# This is a bash code block
# Don't try this at home
sudo rm -rf /
```

Lastly some links were thrown in. [This one](https://hstst2006.github.io/) just takes you to the homepage.
