Every self respecting blog needs a clichéd first post. This is that post. Because the blog is likely going to be programming related it "Hello, world!" is the only proper choice. "Hello, world!" shows that everything works as intended before you start doing serious work.

Since this is the first blog post and a test page, I can use this opportunity to see how the markdown formatting looks on the github pages page for my own future reference. This way I can see how the formatting looks without depending on the "Welcome to Jekyll" blogpost that was graciously supplied with this project template.

Among the included examples were the `file name formatting` of the blogposts in the `_posts` folder: `Year-Month-Date-title.md`

Also some examples on how to format code using tripple \` (tics? backtics?) like so:

```bash
# This is a bash code block
# Don't try this at home
sudo rm -rf /
```

Lastly some links were thrown in. [This one](https://hstst2006.github.io/) just takes you to the homepage.
